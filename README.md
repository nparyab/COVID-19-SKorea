<h1>Overview</h1>
COVID-19 has infected more than 10,000 people in South Korea. KCDC (Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) announces the information of COVID-19 quickly and transparently. This structured dataset is collected in line with the report materials of KCDC and local governments. Intuitively, we are collecting insigts into the dataset by answering some critical questions.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
Thanks sincerely to all the members of KCDC and local governments.

<h2>Data preparation</h2>
Data should be checked for the following items:
<br />
 - Each column is a variable, and each row is an individual
 <br />
 - Number of columns and rows in each of datasets
 <br />
 - Missing data, and whether those missing data should be imputed or removed
 <br />
 - Data types check (if they are loaded as the datatype as we expected)
 <br />
 - Exploratory plots like bar charts and histograms to better understand the data
 <br />

<h2>Insights and Questions</h2>
(1) What are the top 10 sources of infection? 
<br />
(2) How different levels of community interactions are related in terms of virus spread? 
<br />
(3) What were the top 10 provinces where COVID-19 spread the most?
<br />
(4) How different confirmed and recovered cases change over the last month?
<br />
(5) How daily web searches on COVID-19, cold, or flu are related?
